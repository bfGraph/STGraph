        ''' Creates the initial base graph

            Creates the initial base graph based on the first time stamp
            provided in the "graph_updates" dictionary. The dynamic graph
            is for now stored in PCSR format. The CSR arrays are then
            generated for the base graph i.e row_offset, column_indices and eids.

            Parameters:
                graph_updates (dict)    A python dictionary containing the updates made
                                        to a graph dataset over time. Key is the timestamp(str)
                                        and the value is another dictionary. The inside 
                                        dictionary has key values "add" and "delete" which
                                        contains a list of edges(list) that are added or deleted
                                        respectively for a given timestamp
                
                max_num_nodes (int)     Maximum number of nodes present at any given timestamp
                                        for the graph

            the in-degree value of a node with the index as it's

            In-degree is the number of directed edges going into

            a given node is the destination.
