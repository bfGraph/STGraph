# STGraph Graph Abstraction

## Building the Graphs

The graphs' logic is implemented in a CUDA file, which requires compilation using nvcc to generate a shared object (.so) file. This file is then utilized by the Python-based graph abstraction. To compile these files, execute the provided shell scripts.

### Dynamic Graphs

1. Grant execution permissions to the script by executing `chmod u+x build_dynamic.sh`. This step should be performed whenever changes are made to the shell script.

2. Run the script as shown : `./build_dynamic.sh [graph_names]`. For instance: `./build_dynamic.sh gpma pcsr`

### Static Graphs

1. Grant execution permissions to the script by executing `chmod u+x build_static.sh`. This step should be performed whenever changes are made to the shell script.

2. Run the script as shown : `./build_static.sh`.
