# ðŸŒŸ STGraph

STGraph is a framework designed for deep-learning practitioners to write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs). It is built on top of _Seastar_ and utilizes the vertex-centric approach to produce highly efficient fused GPU kernels for forward and backward passes. It achieves better usability, faster computation time and consumes less memory than state-of-the-art graph deep-learning systems like DGL, PyG and PyG-T.

## Why STGraph

![Seastar GCN Formula](https://github.com/bfGraph/STGraph/blob/main/assets/Seastar%20GCN%20Formula.png?raw=true)



The primary goal of _Seastar_ is more natural GNN programming so that the users learning curve is flattened. Our key observation lies in recognizing that the equation governing a GCN layer, as shown above, takes the form of vertex-centric computation and can be implemented succinctly with only one line of code. Moreover, we can see a clear correspondence between the GNN formulas and the vertex-centric implementations. The benefit is two-fold: users can effortlessly implement GNN models, while simultaneously understanding these models by inspecting their direct implementations.

The _Seastar_ system outperforms state-of-the-art GNN frameworks but lacks support for TGNNs. STGraph bridges that gap and enables users to to develop TGNN models through a vertex-centric approach. STGraph has shown to be significantly faster and more memory efficient that state-of-the-art frameworks like PyG-T for training TGNN models.

## Getting Started

### Installation for STGraph Benchmarking

This guide is tailored for benchmarking of the STGraph. We recommend creating a new virtual environment with Python version `3.10` and installing `stgraph` inside that dedicated environment.

**Install the python packages**
```bash
python3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Installing PyTorch, PyG and PyG-T**

In addition, STGraph relies on PyTorch. Ensure it is installed in your virtual environment with the following command

```bash
python3.10 -m pip install torch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.1 torchaudio==2.0.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
```bash
python3.10 -m pip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.0.0+cu118.html
```

```bash
python3.10 -m pip install torch_geometric
```

```bash
python3.10 -m pip install torch-geometric-temporal
```

### Building STGraph

Make sure to go back to the root directory and run the following to build and install STGraph

```
 python3.10 -m build && pip uninstall stgraph -y && pip install dist/stgraph-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
